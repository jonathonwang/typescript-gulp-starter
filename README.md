# Typescript-Gulp-Starter
### Start compiling Typescript with Gulp

#### Install
======
`npm install`
`typings install`

#### Gulp
`gulp` Runs default fulp command.
`gulp watch` Watches for changes on sass and ts files.

======

##### Gulp Packages
This repo comes packaged with many gulp dependencies.
Take a look at gulp.classes.js if you would like to see how the piping is setup.

======
I wrote my own little wrapper functions around gulp tasks to keep the gulpfile.js cleaner.
If you need to add or remove packages from the gulp setup do so in the `gulpconfig/gulp.classes.js`.
